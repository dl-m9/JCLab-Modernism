            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This talk examines recent advancements in wireless networks, emphasizing their ability to support complex applications such as high-speed data transmission in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and engaging experiences in mixed reality (MR) applications. We will discuss two research contributions that introduce innovative solutions in these fields. The first research project presents a cutting-edge framework that employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize cross-layer resource allocation. Instead of directly assigning execution parameters, the framework automates algorithm selection based on real-time traffic conditions, resulting in improved user satisfaction rates compared to traditional cross-layer adaptation techniques. The second study investigates a remote rendering architecture specifically designed for MR applications. By incorporating localization-assisted approaches, this architecture effectively reduces streaming data volume while maintaining accurate object rendering, enabling immersive and engaging MR experiences.</p>
