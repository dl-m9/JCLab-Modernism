            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>With the recent democratization of AI, there is a pressing need of supporting AI on mobile and embedded devices at the edge, to allow intelligent and prompt decision making autonomously on these devices. To meet the devices’ constraints in computing capacity, current software solutions to on-device AI reduce the ML model’s complexity, but have major weaknesses in adapting to the changes of online data patterns and environmental contexts, resulting in significant reduction of model performance in difficult learning tasks. In this talk, I will present our recent research on achieving such full runtime adaptability, as a key enabler for prevalence of on-device AI in practical systems. I will first present how we leverage explainability in AI to adaptively involve the most appropriate model structures for on-device computations, so as to support real-time inference, runtime training and LLM fine-tuning on devices with extreme resource constraints. Afterwards, I will further show how such on-device AI techniques can be applied to various application domains, including smart healthcare and embodied AI systems, to achieve high system performance with heterogeneous data characteristics and diverse environmental settings.</p>
