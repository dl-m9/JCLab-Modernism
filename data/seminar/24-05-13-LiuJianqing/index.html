            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Quantum communications is an emerging communication paradigm with no parallel in classical communication systems. It leverages the unique quantum properties of light to enable unconditionally secure communications and support new engineering applications such as distributed quantum computing and sensing. In this talk, the speaker will begin with an introduction to the basics of quantum communications and the progress of worldwide quantum communication systems. He will specifically use the well-recognized quantum application, quantum key distribution (QKD), to highlight the principles and characteristics of quantum communications. Then, he will discuss the technical challenges and open questions in the field, leading up to a presentation of his group's recent work on distributing quantum cluster states through noisy quantum channels.</p>
