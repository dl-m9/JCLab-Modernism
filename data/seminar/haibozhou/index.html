            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The next-generation mobile communications network is envisioned to face both significant user-side paradigm shifts and network-side challenges, including spectrum resource scarcity, increasing demand for high-quality network service provision, and proliferating network operation costs. In this talk, the speaker will first provide insights into the evolution of RAN by investigating the existing paradigms and future trends and then introduce a disruptive fully-decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN) architecture for 6G, which aligns well with the trends of integrating existing paradigms and new features such as physical decoupling of uplink and downlink base stations. With such a physical split of BS functionalities, the speaker will demonstrate how to naturally implement advanced cooperative transmission techniques such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP), receiver diversity, and hybrid duplex resource allocation and how to leverage the proposed FD-RAN architecture to enhance the spectrum utilization, reduce the network energy consumption, and improve the quality of user experience in 6G.</p>
