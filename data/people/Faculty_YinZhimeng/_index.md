# Biography

I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota (supervised by Prof. Tian He) in 2020. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree (advised by Prof. Hongbo Jiang) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2011 and 2014, respectively.
