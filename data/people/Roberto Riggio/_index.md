I hold the position of Assistant Professor (RTD-B) in the Department of Information Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Marche. 

My research interests revolve around optimization and algorithmic problems in networked and distributed systems. My current fields of applications are edge automation platforms, intelligent networks, serverless computing, and 6G networks.

In the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 5G-CARMEN, I led the first world-wide cross-country validation of 5G for connected, cooperative and automated mobility (CCAM) across the Bologna to Munich 5G Corridor. I am the creator of 5G-EmPOWER the first Network Operating System for Mobile Networks and of LightEdge an ETSI-compliant MEC Platform, both are now used in several EU H2020 Projects and Research Institutions worldwide. I am or have been involved in several 5G-PPP projects and I have directly generated about 4M€ in competitive funding. I have 2 granted patents on network virtualization and I have published more than 120 papers in internationally refereed journals and conferences. I serve in the TPC/OC of leading conferences in the networking field, including IEEE IM/NOMS, IEEE NFV-SDN, IEEE NetSoft, and IEEE CNSM. I am an associate editor for the Wiley International Journal of Network Management, the Springer Wireless Networks journal, and the IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management. I am a member of the ACM and a Senior Member of the IEEE.
