I received a B.E. in Computer Science & Technology from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications in 1999, a M.E. in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications in 2002, and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Florida in 2006. I am a professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering and the director of [Cyber & Network Security Group (CNSG)](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/cnsg/) at Arizona State University. 

My research focuses on cybersecurity and privacy issues in computer and networked systems, with specific emphasis on AI/ML-powered wireless/mobile systems, FutureG wireless networks, dynamic spectrum sharing, mobile crowdsourcing and sensing, Internet-of-Things, social networking and computing, wireless/mobile systems for individuals with disabilities, wearable computing, cloud and edge computing, big data analytics, and wireless/mobile health. I am a recipient of the U.S. NSF CAREER
Award (2009) and an IEEE Fellow for my contributions to wireless and mobile security. I currently serve as the Principal Investigator (PI) and Director of the DoD Center of Excellence in Future Generation Wireless Technology (FutureG) at ASU.

I have served as TPC Co-chair for IEEE INFOCOM 2023 and chaired several other workshops and conferences, including the 2023 NSF Workshop on Security of FutureG and Spectrum Sharing, the 2020 ARO Workshop on Proactive and Autonomous Defenses in Wireless Networks, the 2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS), the 2016 ARO Workshop on Trustworthy Human-Centric Social Networking, and the 2015 NSF Workshop on Wireless Security. Additionally, I have been a member of the editorial boards for several premium IEEE journals, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. My research has been generously supported by esteemed funding agencies, including NSF, ARO/ARL, and DoD. Please feel free to explore my CNSG website to discover more about our team members, ongoing projects, past accomplishments, and the publications we have produced.
