<!-- <p style="text-align:justify">  -->

In recent years, I have been primarily engaged in research related to intelligent wireless sensing, wireless location tracking, intelligent wireless systems, artificial intelligence systems, spectral image processing, multimodal information processing, and deep learning algorithms. I have published over 70 papers in IEEE journals; obtained 15 national invention patents; and successively received awards such as the Second Prize of the Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Award (ranked 1st), the Second Prize of the Ocean Engineering Science and Technology Award, the First Prize of the Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Academic Achievement Award four times (all ranked 1st), and the Second Prize of the Dalian City Natural Science Award. In 2019, I was selected as an innovative talent in Liaoning Province's higher education institutions. In 2018, I was selected as a young talent in the first batch of the Liaoning Province's "Xing Liaoning" Talent Plan and as a young scientific and technological talent in the Ministry of Transport. In 2016, I was selected as a talent in the Liaoning Province's "Thousand Talents" program and received the title of Dalian City's Young Science and Technology Star. I have served as an editor for renowned international journals such as IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology and ACM Computing Surveys. I have collaborated with multiple companies to develop intelligent systems such as fall detection systems based on millimeter-wave radar, wireless vital sign monitoring systems, wireless gesture interaction systems, and high-spectral image intelligent interpretation systems.
