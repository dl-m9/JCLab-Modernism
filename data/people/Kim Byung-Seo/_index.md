I received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from In-Ha University, InChon, Korea in 1998 and received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from University of Florida in 2001 and 2004, respectively.
During Ph.D Study, I have been advised by Professor Yuguang "Michale" Fang in Wireless Networks Group (WINET).

Between 1997 and 1999, I worked for Motorola Korea Ltd., PaJu, Korea as a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Engineer in ATR&D department.
From January 2005 to August 2007, I have been with Motorola Inc. Schaumburg Illinoise as a Sr. Software Engineer in Networks & Enterprise, Motorola Inc.
From September 2007, I have been with Hongik University - Sejong Campus as an Professor in Department of Software and Communications Engineering.

I am an Associate Editor of IEEE Access and IEEE Senior member.
I have been investigating and researching emerging wireless technologies for public safety networks. My research interests include in designing and developing of efficient link-adaptable MAC protocol, cross layer architecture, and resource allocation algorithm for wireless networks.
