## Key Directories
- `/assets`: Contains static assets including presentation slides
- `/data`: Contains structured data about team members and seminars
- `/pages`: Additional website pages
- `/js`: JavaScript modules
- `/tools`: Utility scripts and tools
- `/docs`: Documentation files

## Data Organization
The `/data` directory contains two main sections:
1. `/data/people`: Individual directories for each team member
2. `/data/seminar`: Seminar materials organized by date and presenter

## Development Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Follow the existing CSS class naming conventions
- Keep JavaScript modular and organized
- Update team member data in their respective directories under `/data/people`
- Maintain seminar information under `/data/seminar` with proper date prefixes
