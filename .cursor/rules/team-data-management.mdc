# Team Data Management Guidelines

## Directory Structure
Team member data is organized in the `/data/people` directory with the following categories:
- Faculty members (prefix: `Faculty_`)
- PhD students (prefix: `PhD`)
- Postdoctoral researchers (prefix: `PD_`)
- Visitors (prefix: `Visitor`)
- Former members (prefix: `Former`)

## Adding New Team Members
1. Create a new directory under `/data/people` with the appropriate prefix
2. Follow the naming convention: `[Category]_[Name]` (e.g., `PhD24_LiuLijie`)
3. Include required files in the member's directory:
   - Profile information
   - Publications
   - Research interests
   - Profile photo

## Updating Member Information
- Keep member information up-to-date in their respective directories
- Follow the year-based prefixing system (e.g., PhD23_, PhD24_)
- Maintain consistent formatting across all member profiles
- When a member's status changes, move their directory to the appropriate category

## Data Format Standards
- Use consistent file naming across all member directories
- Maintain uniform data structure for all member profiles
- Follow the established categorization system for different types of members
- Keep historical data organized in the appropriate Former_ categories
