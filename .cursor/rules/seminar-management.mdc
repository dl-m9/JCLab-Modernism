# Seminar Data Management Guidelines

## Directory Structure
Seminar data is stored in the `/data/seminar` directory, organized by date and presenter.

## Naming Convention
- Use the format: `YY-MM-DD-PresenterName`
- Example: `24-05-13-LiuJianqing`

## Required Content
Each seminar directory should contain:
1. Presentation materials (slides, documents)
2. Abstract or summary
3. Speaker information
4. Date and time details
5. Any additional resources or references

## Organization Guidelines
- Keep all seminar materials in their respective dated directories
- Maintain a consistent structure across all seminar entries
- Include both internal and external speaker presentations
- Archive older seminars while maintaining accessibility

## Best Practices
- Update the seminar section promptly after each presentation
- Ensure all materials are properly dated and attributed
- Maintain a consistent format for all seminar documentation
- Include any relevant links or references to related research
